abstract = {Detecting the targets of drugs and other molecules in intact cellular contexts is a major objective in drug discovery and in biology more broadly. Thermal proteome profiling ({TPP}) pursues this aim at proteome-wide scale by inferring target engagement from its effects on temperature-dependent protein denaturation. However, a key challenge of {TPP} is the statistical analysis of the measured melting curves with controlled false discovery rates at high proteome coverage and detection power. We present non-parametric analysis of response curves ({NPARC}), a statistical method for {TPP} based on functional data analysis and nonlinear regression. We evaluate {NPARC} on five independent {TPP} datasets and observe that it is able to detect subtle changes in any region of the melting curves, reliably detects the known targets, and outperforms a melting point-centric, single-parameter fitting approach in terms of specificity and sensitivity. {NPARC} can be combined with established analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) statistics and enables flexible, factorial experimental designs and replication levels. To facilitate access to a wide range of users, a freely available software implementation of {NPARC} is provided.
